Herodian οη Grammatico! Fiqurcs: The Alcmanic ‘ figure '
is that whereby plural or dual nouns1 or verbs are placed
between singular nouus which go together. It occurs four
times in Homer . . . ; but it is more frequent in the lyric
poet Alcman3 whence its name. One has only to go as far
as his second ode to find :

O Castor—ye tamers of swift steeds, ye skilful
horsemen—-and noble Polydeuces 2

Scholiast on Vergil [Such was Cyllarus when he bent to
the rein of PolluxJ: . . . According to the lyric poet
Alcman, the horses given by Neptune to J uno were named
Cyllarus (or Bowlegs) and Xanthus (or Bayard), Cyllarus
being given to Pollux and Xanthus to his brother.

Aelian On Animals: Homer, being a poet, deserves our
pardon for giving the horse Xanthus speech; and Alcman
should not be blamed for imitating Homer in such matters.
