Apollonius Homeric- Lexicon: Some writers give the name
of beast. to lions, leopards, wolves‚ and all similar animals,
that of creeping-thing generically to the various kinds of
snakes, that. of monster to cetaceans such as whales ; which Ι
is the distinction made by Alcman in the lines :

Asleep lie mountain-top and mountain-gully,
shoulder also and ravine3 the creeping-things that
come from the dark earth, the beasts whose lying
is upon the hillside, the generation of the bees, the
monsters in the depths of the purple brine, all lie
asleep, and with them the tribes of the winging birds.
