132 [To Lovss ?]

Etymoloyicum Guclianum: For flowers are called gentle
[that is, cultivated as opposed to wild,] because they grow
in the Spring which is the particular season of love. And
that is why Alcaeus calls Love the child of Zephyr or the
W est· Wind and Iris or the Rainbow.

Plutarch Αὶῑαίονίιιε. Although the poets generall) seem
to write and sing praise of Love in a jesting mood, some·
times, whether of their own choice and reflexion or bv the
grace of God, they get at the truth and tieat of him
serious ly, as f'or instance in the matter of his birth:

. . awfullest of Gods, whom sandalled Iris bore
to Zephyr of the golden hair .
—unless indeed you follow the grammarians in holding that

the description is aimed at the motley and various nature of
the passion. ·

14 To THE Dioscunl
From a Second-Century Papyrus:

Come ye hither from star-bright Olympus, ye
stalwart children of Zeus and Leda, and shine forth
in propitious wisc, O Castor and Polydeuces, who go
on swift-footed horses over broad earth and all the
sea, and do so easily save men from lamentable death
