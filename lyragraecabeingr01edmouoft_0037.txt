says this, he does not realise that the magadis is an
ancient instrument, because Pindar plainly states
that Terpander invented the barbitos 01· lyre to
respond 1 to the Lydian pectis or lute, in the words
‘ Which Lesbian Terpander invented of old to vibrate
in answer to the low-pitched lute at the feasts of the
Lydians;‘ and the pectis and the magadis are the
same . . . It is clear that Terpander was earlier
than Anacreon from the following considerations.
According to Hellanicus both in his metrical and in
his formal lists of Victors at the Carneian Festival,
the first recorded name is Terpander's3 and we
know from Sosibius' Cleronologq that the festival was
founded in the fflith 013111piad (Β. c. (576- ‹57- ὴ) while
