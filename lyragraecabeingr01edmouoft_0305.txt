Athenaeus Doclors a( Diuum: According to some accounts
the wine-bearer of the Gods was Harmonia. . . . But Alcaeus
makes Hermes also their wine-bearer, as indeed Sappho doe<
in the following passage z

There stood a mixing-bowl of ambrosia ready mixed,
and Hermes took the wine-jug to pour out for the
Gods. And then they all took up the beakers, and

pouring a libation wished all manner of good luck to
the bridegroom.2

Himerius Epithalamy os Severus : And isan ode were needed
I should give such a song as this: Bride that teemest with
rosy desires, bride the fan-est ornament of the Queen of
Paphos, hie thee to bed, hie thee to the conch whereon thou
must sweetly sport in gentle wise with thy bridegroom. And
may the Star of Eve lead thee full willingly to the place

where thou shalt marvel at the silver-throned Lady of
Wedlock.³

fuse two ancient editions ; cf. 162 and on 48 ‘³ ll. 3, 4 (not
quite certainly to be joined directly to ΞΖ) from Ath. ‘ Sappho,

cf. Macr. 5. 21. 6, Ath. 2. :39 a, 5. 192 c, Eust. Oci. 1633. l, Il.
