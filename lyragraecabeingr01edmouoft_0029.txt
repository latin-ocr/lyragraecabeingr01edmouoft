have invented not only the Enhwimoni( scale but
the two 1h3thms known ·ι5 the Prosodiw (-—— ),
which is that of the Nome of Αι·(5 ⁸md the (hone
(υ uu) which occurs so frequently in th( tunes used 111
the worship ofobele'l'1ht Bw< 1ηιι5 (ι--) also is
sometimes ascribed to him. 1 These stitmiieiits ·11e
borne out by each of the ancient melodieS.

Plutarch ()η Music: Takc sor instance the Enliar-
monic scale employed by (ss)lympus with the Phrygiam
mode and the Epibatic Paeon‚‘-' the combination which
gives its character to the opening· of the Noine to
Athena. Both melody and rhythm make their con-
tribution, the metre beinp merely ch· -moed in ·ι
cunning way so ·1s to become as it were t1··:o<h1i‹·
instead of paeonic,·1nd the effect is completed b3
the use of the E1111·n·1n<›1]i(·3(ale of Olympus.

The Same: Moreover, although the ancient poets
used only some of the ‘modes' they knew them
all. It is not through ignum-anve that they con-
* fine themselves to employing so few st1·ings,3 or
that composers like Olympus and Terpander and
their followers denied themselves the use of many
strings and the variety which that entails. 'l‘his is
clear both from the w·o1ks of Olympus and '‘·le1-
p ⁸·1nde1 and those of the (omposers w ho belono to the
same school. ’11]ουσῦ tl1e3 are quite simple and
written only for a iew strin⁰s‚ they 50 far excel the
elaborate works written for many, that the style of
’ Olympus remains inimitable and the exponents of
the opposite principle have to take the second place.
