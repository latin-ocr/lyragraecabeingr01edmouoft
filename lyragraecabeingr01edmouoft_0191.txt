LlFE OF SAPPHO

Plutarch Dinuer-Table Problems [on what is the
best sort of entertainment during dinner]: We were
the first to fall foul of the new fashion when it came
to Rome, and to deprecate the use of Plato as an
after-dinner diversion and his dialogues as things
to be listened to over the wine and the dessert.
Why, even when they recite us Sappho or Anacreon
I feel I must put down my cup sor very shame.

The Same Annzloriusz Sappho fully deserves to be
countcd among the Muses, The Romans tell how
Cacus son of Vulean sent forth fi're and flames from
his mouth, and Sappho utters words really mingled
with fire, and gives vent through her song to the
heat that consumes 1101· heart, thus ‘healing' in
the words of Philoxenus ‘the pain of love with
the melodies of the Muse.' 1

The Same Dimzer- Table Problems: One day at
Sossius’s, after the singing of some songs of Sappho’s,
a discussion arose of the line ‘ Love makes a poet of
the veriest boor.'

Aulus Gellius Attic Niglels : When the chief courses
were disposed of and the time was come for wine
and conversation, Antonius expressed a wish that
we might be favoured with a performanee by 1110
first-rate singers and players of both sexes whom he
knew our young friend 10 have at command. In
due time the young musicians were summoned, and
proceeded 10 give delightful renderings not only of
a number of the songs of Anacreon and Sappho but
also of some charming erotic elegieS, as they are
called, of modern composers.
