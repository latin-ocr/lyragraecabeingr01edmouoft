Α LCAEUS

[Speed thee, herald, to lovely Mytilene and say
to my dearest Melanippus ε] ‘Your Alcaeus is safe
as you see,l but not his arms3 that shield of evei·-
lasting 1night2 the Athenians have hung up in the
temple of the Grey—Eyed Goddess.'

122 To MELANJPPUS 3

From a Second-Centum· Papyrus :

O why, Melanippus, do you pray you might be
with me? or why, when once Fate has sent 1116 to
eddying Acheron, shall 1 hope to re-cross it and see
again the pure light of the sun? Nay‚ set not your
desire on things too great. King Sisyphus son of
Aeolus, he thought with a craft unsurpassed to have
escaped death3 but for all his cunning he crossed
the eddying Acheron in fate the second time, and
the Son of Cronus ordained that he should have
below a toil the woefullest 111 all the world. So l
pray you bewail not these things. If ever eries
were unavailing, our cries are unavailing now.
Assuredly some of these things were to be suffered
with an enduring heart. When the wind rises in the
north4 [no skilful pilot puts out into the wide sea]

like the use of the word ‘ herald‚' has a humorous intention

of low birth and Thracian extraction
