Old Ecynzoloqzuum illaquam: σείω ‘to shake’; there is a

πνεω ‘RVG ω .

Athenaeus Ilm-[0725 at Dinncr [on shellfish]: . . . Aristo-
phanes the grammarian . . . declares the Zepas· to resemble

what is called the tellina. But Callias of Mytilene, in his
tract On cho Lepas os Alcaeus, says that there is a song in
Alcaeus beginning :

Child of the rock and the grey sea
and ending ι

. and thou fillest all hearts with pride, thou
lepus of the sea.1

Instead of lepus, however, Aristophanes reads chelys, ‘ tor-
toise2 or t-urtle,' and says that Dicaearchus³ reads lepras
without understanding what a sepas was, namely a shell
which playing children used to put in their mouths to make
a whistle, as our guttersnipes (lo with what is called the
tellina.

Hephaestion Hamlbook of Mem [on the ionivum a ⁷1ziw›7·e]:

And whole poenis are written in ionics, for instance . . .,
and many by Alcaeus, as :

Me a woman miserable, me a sharer in all mis-
fortune

¹ metre as 81 ² the same word means lyre, the earliest
lyres having been made of tortoiseshell ; the poem was
apparently an address to the trumpet (see L. and S. σάλπιγξ)
which Ar. altered into an address to the lyve ³ in his tract
οη Alcaeus Ath. 15. 668 e ⁴ cf. Heph. 123—4, who implies
that the stanzas each contained 10 feet like Hor. 3. 1⁶2, and
