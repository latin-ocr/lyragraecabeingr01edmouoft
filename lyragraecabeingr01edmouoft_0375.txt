ALCAEUS
49

Apollonius Pronozcns: ὔμμε ‘ you} Aeolic; compare

For the prerogative which belongs to you by
grace of the Gods, he will make the prerogative
of insatiate men.

Scholiasta on Aristophanes W asps [where itt is parodied] :
From Alcaeus:

This man with his longing for great power will
quickly overturn his country3 she is tottering now 1 ;

κρέτος ‘ power’ instead of κράτος ; 116 is parodying Alcaeus in
reference to Cleon, as being a ωειάῐηειῃ.2

Diogenes Laertius sze of Pittacus: This is he whom Alcaeus
calls Draq-soot because he was flat-footed and (lragged or
trailed his feet after him, Splz‘tsoot because of the so-called
chaps or cracks in the skin between his toes, Prancer because
he bore himself proudly without reason, Puddinq-bellgs or
great-pauneh because he was fat, &milche-clam because 116
did not use lamPS,⁴ and &cept-and·Gai->lislam because 116 was
slovenly and dirty.

¹ the Gk. is ‘near a swing-down' (of the scales and the
31ike) '² the scholiast implies that Ar. parodied μαιόμενος
.‘ longing for ’ with μαινόμενος ⁶ mad on ’ ³ cf. Suid. «rapuimus,
2P011. 2. 1715, Plut. Qu. Οοηυ. 8. 6. l ⁴ the true explanation
‘is more probably that he supped long and late3 Hesych.
*however explains it as ‘supping in the dark, eating in
-secret'
