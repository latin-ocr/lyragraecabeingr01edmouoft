SAPPHO

38 To ANACTORIA 1
From a Second-Century Papyrus :

The fairest thing in all the world some say is a
host of foot, and some again a navy of ships, but to
me 'tis the heart’s beloved. And 'tis easy to make
this understood by any. Though Helen surveyed
much mortal beauty, 5116 chose for most beautiful
the destroyer of all the honour of Troy, and thought
not so much either of child or parent dear, but was
led astray by Love to bestow her beart afar; for
woman is ever easy to be bent when she· thinks
lightly of what is near and dear. See to it then that
you remember us Anactoria, now that we 2 are parted
from one of whom I would rather the sweet sound of
her footfall and the sight of the brightness of her
beaming face than all the chal-iots and armoured
footmen of Lydia. I know that in this world man
cannot have the best; yet to wish that one had a

· share [in what was once shared is better than to
ᾗ forget it.] 3
- ¹ a complete letter to Anactoria who has apparently gone

with a soldier husband to Lydia, cf. 8ss ² S. and Atthis?
³ ref. to the old friendship between her and S.
