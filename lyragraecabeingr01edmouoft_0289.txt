too, are more apt to look with favour 011 that which
is adorned with flowers, whereas they turn away

heads on the plea that that which is the more adorned with
flowers is the more pleasing to the Gods.

Athenaeus Docto-122: αί Dc'nner: Do you think that ‹lelicacy
or refinement without virtue is a thing to be desired ἶ) thy,
Sappho, who was a woman out and out and a poetess, too,
hesitated nevertheless to separate 1·efinement from honour,
for she says:

. But I love delicacy, aud the bright and the
figlilittifl'ul belong for me to the desire of the sun-

making it clear that the desire to live comprehended for
her the bright or famous and the beautiful or honourable3
and these belong to virtue.

1192 To ALCAEUS

Aristotle Rhetoric: For we are ashamed of what is shame-
ful, whether in word or deed or intenti0n3 compare Sappho's
answer when Alcaeus said, ‘ I fain would tell you something,
but shame restrains me ε’

If your desile were of things good or fair, and
your tongue were not mixing a ²³draught of ill w·01ds,
then would not shame possess §om eye, but §ou
would make your plea outright.

¹ pace A,thenaeus S. probably means physioal brightnes s
and beauty; without them life would not be worth living

an amoeboeic poem of S. )
