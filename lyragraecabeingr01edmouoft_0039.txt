and changed the style ot music :⁷3⁸1 years, in the
archonship of Dropides at Athens (ιμ’. ‹31:3).

Eusebius C'leronivle: Olympiad :3:3. 2 (ης. (317)
Flourished Terpander the §inger to the lyre.

Timotheus Pensm: In the beginning did Orpheus
son of Calliope beget the motley-musicked shell on
Mount Pieria, and after him came the famous Ter-
pander, born of Aeoliam Lesbos at Antissa, and
yoked the Muse unto poenis ten. And lo! now
Timotheus giveth the lyre new lise with times and
measures of eleven stringe.

Aristotle Problems: Why is the oet-dre described
as diapason or ‘at an interval of all,' rather thanv
numerically ‘at an interval of eight-,² as we say ‘at
an interval of four' or ‘of five Ῥ Is it because the
strings were in old times seven, and Terpander
removed the ‘third’ when he added the nell* or
‘highests thus keeping the total seven and not
xincreasing it to eigl1t?1
‘J Plutarch οη Meas-ic: The musical historians attrib-
uted the Dorian nese or oetave-note to Terpander,
musicians before him not having employed it.

The Same [on Timotheus]: Down to the time os
Aristocleides the lyre had had seven strings. Timo-
‘theus divided the Terpandrean mode into a greater
‚number of notes.2

Hesiod, or again of Homer, with the pedigree
