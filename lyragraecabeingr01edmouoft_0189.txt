LIFE OF SAPPHO

thing53 Anacreon was attended by Persuasion3 and
Lesbian Alcaeus spake varied notes unto the wise
Aeolian dame.1 But Sappho was not ninth among
the men3 rather is she written tenth in the list of
the lovely Muses,

Catullus: . . . thou maiden more cultured than
the Sapphic Muse.

Horace: . . . Still breathes the love, still lives
the flame, which the Aeolian maid confided to her
strings.

The Same: The virile Sappho shapes her Muse
· with the mette of Archilochus.

Palatine Atztleology : Pinytus on Sappho ε This
tomb hath the bones and the dumb name of Sappho,
but her wise utterances are immortal.

The Same: Tullius Laureas on the same: When
you pass my Aeolian grave, stranger, call not the
songstress of Mytilene dead. For ’tis true this was
built by the hands of men, and such works of human-
kind sink swiftly into oblivion; yet if you ask after
me for the sake of the holy Muses from each of
whom I have taken a flower for my posy of ‚nine,·2
you shall know that I have escaped the darkness of
Death‚ and no sun shall ever be that keepeth not
the name of the lyrist Sappho.

Plutarch Pythian Orac-les: ‘Do you not see] he
asked, ‘what a charm the songs of Sappho have to
enchant and bewitch the listene1·?'
