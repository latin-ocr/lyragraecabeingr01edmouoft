SAPPHO
47 1

From a Second-Century Papyrus :
&9- . . . And we maidens spend all the night
1 at this door, singing of the love that is be-
* tween thee, thrice happy bridegroom, and a
bride whose breast is sweet as violets. But
get thee up and go when the dawn shall
come, and may great Hermes lead thy feet
where thou shall: find just so much ill-luck
’ as we shall see sleep ’co-night.

Hephaestion Ham‘lbook· of Metro [011 1110 Aeolio line]: Of
the acatalectic kinds of Aeolio verse 1110 pentameter is called
the Sapphio fmwteen-syllaffle, 111 which is written 1110 whole
of Sappho's second Book ; compare ‘ I loved . . . ag0.'

Plutarch Amatorius: For the yielding of the female 10 1110
malo is called hy the ancients χάρις ‘ grace ⁹ ; compare Pindar
where he says that 1110 Centaur was born of Hera ‘ without
grace,’ and Sappho's uso of ἄχαρις ‘ graceless ' of 1110 girl who
was not yet ripe for marriage, ‘ You seemed . . . child ’

preserving what, was prob. Sis own arrangement, that accord-
ing 10 subject-manem the former being presumably made
from the latter, it is only to be expected that some at least
of 1110 metrieally-arran god Books would end with epithalamies
if they formed the last Book of the earlier editi0n; cf. 1110
final poem of Book VII (1:35)
