A LCAEUS

usin his treatwise οη P1·0‹·01·l›‚·; Aristodemus 15· not named by
Pindar, as though it were obvious who the author is; he
merely indicates that the place of his birth was Argos.
Alcaeus on the other hand gives both name and birthplace,
making the latter Spart-1, not Arc os:

For ev en as once on a d· 13 ’tis told Aristodemus

From a Papyrus of the First Ceutury lac. found ab

Herculaneum, Demetrius 011, Poems:

,And to d1ink sec-med to him a pleasv 111:
thing3 but 0116 that hath 5ο much wine as that
about his wits, suc-h an one lix es no life at all; for he
hangs his head, chiding oft his own beart and re-
penting him of what he hath done. And so it ceased
to please him when he came to his ripes’c.

And we find the same sort of sentiment in Ibycus.

also used an acatalectie pentameter:

Sprung from the royal son of Cronus, Ajax second
in valour to Achilles . . .
