LIFE OF SAPPHO

Philostratus sze (ff Apollonius of Tyana : So Apol
10111115 entered the king's palace, accompanied by a
number of people thho lwnowing that he 11 111 been
pleased to hear of his ariiv 11 111 Babx lon thought
that this would gratify the ling. As he passed 111
however, the philosophei paid no attention whatex er
to the w·onde1s of the house, but w alking by them
as though he were travelling 011 1116 111311 road, called
Damis to him and said: ‘You asked me the other
day the name of the fair Pamphylian ‘who is said to
have been associated with Sappho and to have com-
posed the hymns they sing to Artemis of Perga 111
1116 Aeolian and Pamphylian modes.' ‘So I did,' he
replied3 ‘but received no answer.' ‘ No, my friend,
but you received an account of the tunes of the
hymns and the names they are known by, and how
she changed the Aeolian peculiarities into her own
noble Pamphylian. We then turned to something
else, and you did not repeat your original request.
Well, this elever woman's name was Damophyla,
and she is said to have had girl-companions like
Sappho, and to have composed love-poenis and
hymns just as she did. The hymns to Artemis are
her adaptations of her teacher’s work, deriving
ultimately from Sapphic originals.'

Horace Odes [lll-omened was the day of your
planting, good tree . . .:] How near was I to be-
holding the realm of gloomy Proserpine with Aeacus
holding court, how near to seeing the abodes assigned
the holy dead, with Sappho singing elegies to the
Aeolian string upon the girls of her city, and thee,
Alcaeus, chanting with fuller note and quill of
gold . . .
