with him.l Among those who did so was one who
in her disappointment is said to have thrown her-·
self from Mount LeucateS, and from this came. the
custom now in vogue of hiring people once a year
to throw themselves from that place into the sea.2

Suidas Lemicon: Phaon: <Yon are a Phaon both
in looks and deeds> 3 ; this proverb is used of those
who are lover and disdainful. They say that this
Phaon was beloved by many women, among them
Sappho, not the poetess but another Lesbian, who
failing to win him threw herself from the Leucadian

Cliff.

Athenaeus Βορέω-,1- at Dz'mzcr: According to Cra-
tinus, Aphrodite when beloved by Phaon concealed
him among the ‘fair wild-lettuces’; but according
to the younger Marsyas the hiding-place was among
the growing bal-ley.

Ι to do with Lesbos? I am fain to be a Siciliam.
