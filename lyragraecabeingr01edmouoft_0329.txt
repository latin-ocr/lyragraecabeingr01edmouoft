Scholiasta on Iliad [ἀΐδρεϊ ‘unknowing iguor.111t’]: The
genitive to the nominative ἄϊδρις ought to be ἀΐδρεος and the
dative ἀΐδρει; for it ought not to have a δ in it, since it is

‚i not a derivative with a long vowel in the penultimate
l syllable, but ought to be declined like ἔχις, πόσις, and ὅφις;
ἱ and therefore the form πολυίδριδι,

learned,

used by Sappho is wrong; unless indeed this was declined
⁵ as it was iu Attic, for Sophocles used the accusative ἵδρεδα
i and Phrynichus the nominative plural ἴδριδες.
