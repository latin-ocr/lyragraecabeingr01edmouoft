ALCMAN

87

Strabo Geoyraphy [on Crete] : Ephorus says that the publio
mess is still called ἀνδρεῖα οι· ‘the men's mess ’ in Crete, but,
that at Sparta that name is obsoleto, though it, occurs in
Alcman as follows :

At feasts and in the companies of the men's mess
'tis well beside them that sit at meat to strike up

and sing the Paean.1

88

Athenaeus Doctors ab Dimzer [on nectam: I know that,
Alexandrides says that nectar is not the (iods' drink but,

their food ; . . . and Alcman says ε
to do nothing but eat of 'che nectem-‚²
89

Scholiast on Pindar [woe . . . which his father hung over
him, that mighty stone]: Alcaeus and Alcman say that a
{goze hung over Tantalus 3 Alcaeus thus (fr. 57), and Alcman

He sat, a wicked man, among pleasant things,
upon a seat rock-o'erhung, thinking he saw and
seeing not.3

Cramer Inedim (Oxford) [on ὕπαιθα] : This word is also used
mig-1¹33& 3&he syllable θα in Alcman, and it means πρότερον

'Twas long ago that Hippolochus did fall, but he
bath received a farne that even now hath not deserted

him ;
instead of πρότερον ; it is accented on the first syllable.
