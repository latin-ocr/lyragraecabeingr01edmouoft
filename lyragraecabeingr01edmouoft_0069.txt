L1 FE OF ALCMAN

there are shrines of Alcimus and Enarsphorus and,
close by, one of Dorceus, and adjoining this again
one of Sebrus, all of whom are said to have been sons
‘of Hippocoon. The spring near one of them is
called Dorccian after Dorceus, and the plot near
another, Sebrian after Sebrus. On the right of this
plot is a monument to Alcman ‘ whose poenis were
not made the less sweet because he used the tongue
of Spartaj a dialect not too euphonious. The temples
of Helen and Heracles lie the one near the tomb of
Alcman, the other close to the wall. In the latter
there is a statue of Heracles armed, this form being
due, it is said, to the fight he had with Hippocoon
ἱ and his sons.
