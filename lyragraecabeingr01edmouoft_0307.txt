SAPPHO

143

Demetrius On Slgsle: And there is a charm peculiarly
Sapphic in metabole or change, when having said something
she turns round and, as it were, changes her mind, for
instance:

Up with the rafters high,

Hofor the wedding ! 1

Raise them high, γε joiners,
Hofor the nredcling Ι

The bridegroom ’s as tall as Ares,
Hofor the wedding !

Far taller than a 'call man,

Hofor {he wedding l

Towering as the Lesbian poet
Hosor tlze wedding ,Ι

Over the poets of other lands,
Hofor the wedding J ’

as it were interrupting herself because she has used an
impossible hyperbole, no one really being as tall as Ares.

149 2

The Same: Sometimes, too, Sappho derives charm from
gnaphora or repetition, as in this passage, of the *Evening
tar:

Evening Star that bringest back all that lightsorne
Dawn hath scattered afar, thou bringest the sheep,

² the refrain, omitted by Dem.‚ occurs in Heph„ who
quotes ll. 1-5 to illustrate the ⁴ intervening’ refrain: ll. 9-11
from Dem. ΕΖ. 146 ⁴ by conlparison, moreover, S. says of the
very tall man “Toxvering, etc.‘'; for the comparison there
conveys charm rather than a sense of size’ 2 cf. EM.
