LIFE OF SAPPHO

Seneca Letlers to Lucilius: The grammarian Didy-
mus wrote four thousand books. Ι should pity him
if he had merely read so many useless works. The
list includes treatises in which he discusses the
birthplace of Homer, the true mother of Aeneas,
whether Anacreon was more of a rake than a sot,
whether Sappho was a prostitute, and other ques-
tions the answers to which you ought to forget if
you knew them. And then people complain that
life is short.1

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: Naucratis too was
the home of some famous and extremely beautiful
courtesans. Doricha, who became the mistress of
Sappho's brother Charaxus when his business took
him to Naucratis, is trounced by his sister in a poem
for having fleeced him? But Herodotus calls her
Rhodopisff not understanding that Doricha is not
the same as the woman who dedicated at Delphi
the famous spits mentioned by Cratinus . . ‚4 The
following epigram w as written on Doricha by Posei-

Sappho's dear song abides and ever will. Happy
