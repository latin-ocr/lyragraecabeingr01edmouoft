Athenaeus Doctors at Dz‘mwr [on ‘pan-baked' loaves]:
According to Apollodorus this is the name of a kind of eake
in Alcman3 and similarly Sosibius in the third Book of his
treatise οη Alcman, declaring that they are shaped like a
woman’s breast and are used at Sparta for women's feasts‚
being carried round just before the attendants in the chorus
sing the eulogy they have prepared in honour of the Maid.

The Same [on loaves]: The θριδακίσκαι of Alcman are the
same as the Attic θριδακῖναι or lettuces; the passage of
Alcman runs thus ι

making a pile of lettuces and pan-baked loaves
