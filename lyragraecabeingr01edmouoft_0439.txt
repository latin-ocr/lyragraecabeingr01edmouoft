ALCAEUS
157 ¹

Athenaeus Doctors αι Dimzer: For the poet Alcaeus is
found drinking at every time and on every occasion ; in the
winter in these lines :

The Sky-God bows himself; there is a great
storm in the heavens, the streams of water are
frozen fast. . . . Defy the storm with a good fire
and a bountiful mixing of honey-sweet wine, and

then put a soft cushion on either side your brow.

158

The Same: . . . and in his misfortune, in this passage :

lt is ill yielding the heart ’co mischance3 for we
shall make no advance if we weary of thee, O
Bacchus, and the best medicine is to call for wine
and drink deep.

159 ²
The Same: They called the garlands which they used to
tie round their neeks hypothymides 3 compare Alcaeus :
But let them put garlands woven of anise about
our nec-ks and pour sweet myrrh over our bosoms.³
