LlFE OF SAPPHO

Lucian Loves: If women had a parliament and
law-courts and a share in politics, you would have
been elected geum-il οι· president, Charicles, and
they would have put up bionze statues in >our
honour in the niaiket- place. Indeed, had all the
wisest and cleverest of their own sex been given the
opportunity, they could hardly have proved better
champions of its cause, not even Telesilla, who took
arms against the Spartan nobles and thus caused
Ares to be reckoned at Argos a woman's God, nor
yet SapphO, the delicious glory of the Lesbians, or
Theano the daughter of the wisdom of Pythagoras.
Nay, Pericles could hardly have made out so good a
case for Aspasia.

The Same On Paid Companions: For ladies make
a great point of having persons of education in their
pay, to attend upon them and accompany them
when they go abroad in their chairs, since there is
nothing on which they pride themselves more than
that it should be said that they are ladies of culture
and learning and write poenis almost as good as

Sappho's.

Cicero Orations against Verres: The Sappho which
was stolen from the town-hall of Syracuse,1 that,
I admit, almost grants you extenuation. Could this
work of Silanion, so perfect, so refined, so finished,
be in fitter hands public oi· private than those of a
man so refined and cultured as Verres? . . . And
how sorely this stolen Sappho was missed is almost
more than words can tell. Not only was the poetess
exquisitely portrayed, but there was a world-famous

(above), is thought to be an indication that Sappho's Sicilian
exile was spent at Syracuse
