Aristides On the E'xtemporised Adclitz‘on: I think you
must have heard how Sappho, too, once boasted to certain
women reputed prosperous, that the Muses had given herself
the true happiness and good fortune, and even when she
was dead she would not be forgotten.

e. g. But 1 have received true prosperity from
the golden Muses, and when I die Ι shall
not be forgot.

These songs Iwill sing right well ’co-day for the
delight of my comrades.
