Aristides Orationss [praise of Smyrna] . . . the glamour
that is upon the whole city, not as Sappho said, blinding the
eyeS, but magnifying it and wreathiug it and moreover
watering it. with joyfulness‚—not› indeed ‘like a hyacinth
flower,' but such as earth and sun never before have shown

Aristotle leeoric . . . . Or, as Sappho says:

Death is an ill ; the Gocls at least think so,
Or else themselves had perished long ago.

Eustathius opuscula [a letter]: These spies were intro-
duced into my estate by no harlot like her of Jericho‚ a
friendship I mean of a vagrant sort· which deems, as Sappho
would say, a public thing beautiful, but a pure one and as
virgin as Hesiod's Justice‚ unapproachable to the many.

e. g. . . . with whom you are mingled in a vagrani:
friendship which deems that beautiful which
. any man may have for the asking.²
