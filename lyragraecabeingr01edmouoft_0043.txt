LIFE OF TERPANDER

of Terpander, were first named by him, and are
these: Boeotiam, Aeolian, Trochaic, Higlipitched,
Cepion, Terpandrean, and Four-song. Terpander
also wrote lyric Prcludes in epic metre; and it
becomes clear that the ancient lyre-sung· nomes
were composed of epic lines, if we consider that
Timotheus, when he employed the dithyrambic
style, interspersed his earlier nonies with them, in
order to avoid the appearance of breaking· the rulcs
of the ancient music. There is reason to believe
that Terpander was supreme in the art of the lyre-
song. It is recorded that he won the prize at the
Pythian Games four times running3 aud the period
at which he lived must have been very early, because
Glaucus the Italian in his Histmjzs of tlte Ancient
Poels (md AIusicizuw puts him before Archilochus,
making him only a very little later than the first
composers for the flute.

Alexander, in his Colleesions on Phrygia, declares
,‚ that instrumental music was introduced into Greece
by Olympus, and also by the Idaean Dactyls or
Priests of Cybele, and that while the first flute-
player was Hyagnis, who was followed by his son
Marsyas, who was succeeded by Olympus, Terpander
(the lyrist) emulated in his verse Homer and in his
‘music Orpheus, who appears ’co have been entirely
original. . . . It is said that some of the citharoedic
or lyre—sung nomes thought to be the work of
Terpander were really composed by the ancient
'Delphian composer Philammon.

In fine, lyric song continued from Terpander’s time
to that of Phrynis to be wholly simple. Poets were
not permitted in those days to compose for the lyre
