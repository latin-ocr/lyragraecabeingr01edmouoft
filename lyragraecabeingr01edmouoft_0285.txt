And there are brachycatalectic trimeters, namely what are
called Praxilleans, which have the first meter ionic and the
second trochaic‚ such as the following lines of Sappho:

The Moon rose full, and the maidens, taking their
stand about the altar . . . 2

113 A and B

From a Papyrus of about ΛΦ. 100 [on the Anacreontic
metre] : Similarly with the Praxillean, if you cut off its first
two syllables you will make the Anacreontic; or putting it
· generally as in the preceding case (of the Phalaecian)‚ you
will make it in like manner if you remove all the first ἱοοι)3
except one short. Consider the following lines when docked
of their first syllables (—fr. 112 tlze7z—) :

Both happiness and health . . .

I pray Ih4may escape [old ageJ, my children;
yout . . .
