ning w‘ith a syllable which is long by na.ture But. Alcaeus
uses the form nith either ὅ or ῦ, sa3ing ὠρ ανός with the
change of the diphthong oza to ὅ, and also, without the υ.
ὀρανός, so that the exception we are discussing does not hold

A little thing of two cubits’ stature like me could
not expect to touch the sky.
