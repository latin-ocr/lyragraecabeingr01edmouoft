Aristides The Four Great Athenians ²: But I will admit this
in Plato’s favour; granted the ‘brackish [or bitter] neigh-
bour,' as he calls it (Laws 475 a).

Scholiast on the passage: Brackish neighbour: from
Alcman the lyrist, meaning ‘it is a bad thing to have
the sea for a neighbour.'. . . So the orator means ‘let us
admit that Athens was situate near the sea.’

Arsenius V iolet-Bed :

Look thou from afar upon a brackish neighbour.

Aristides On the Extemporised Α ιῖαἶίίίοη ε In another passage,
by way of displaying the greatness of his own fame, Alcman
makes so preposterous an enumeration of peoples, that the
hapless scholar to this day is trying to find out where in the
world they can be, and it would pay him better, I think, to
retrace his steps for many miles than to spend his time over
the Sciapods or Shadow-feet.

” Strabo Geoqrapky: One can hardly charge Hesiod with
ignorance for speaking of the Demi-dogs . . . nor yet Alcman
for mentioning the Steganopods or Shelte1·-feet.·2

Diodorus of Sicily Historical Library: For most of the
mythologists, and these the most approved, say that the
Muses are the daughters of Zeus and Memory, but a. few
of the poete, and among these Alcman, represent them as
daughters of Heaven and Earth.³
