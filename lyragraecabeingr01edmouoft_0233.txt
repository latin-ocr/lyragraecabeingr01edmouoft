From the Same and another of the Third Century:

Make stand beside me in a dream, great Hera,
the beauteous shape that appeared in answer to the
prayer of the famous kings of Atreus’ seed when
they had made an end of the overthrow of Troy.
At first when they put forth hither from Scamander's
swift flood, they could not win home, but ere that
could be, were fain to make prayer to thee and to
mighty Zeus and to Thyone’s lovely child.1 So now

ag. pray I, O Lady, that of thy grace Ι may do
again, as of old, things, pure and beautiful
among the maids of Mytilene, whom Ι have
= so often taught to dance and to sing upon

’ . thy feast-days; and even as Atreus' seed by

Ι grace of thee and thy fellow-Gods did put

out then from Ilium, so I beseeeh thee, gentle

3 Hera, aid thou now this homeward voyage

1 of mine.

¹ the latter half is very tentatively restored on the sup-

’ position that S. writes this before embarking to return to
, Mytilene froin Syracuse on hearing of the amnesty
