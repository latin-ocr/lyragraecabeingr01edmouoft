SAPPHO

128
· Etymoloqicmn Illaynnm z δαύω ‘ Ι sleep ’ ; Sappho:

May you sleep in the bosom of a tender
comrade . . .

And Herodian says that the word occurs once in Sappho.

129 To THE Musas

Hephaestion Handbook of M etre [on ‘ unconnectable '
metres]: And the line which is composesl of two ithyphallics
is used by Sappho:

O come hither, ye Muses, from your golden

[house] . . .
1301 To CLI-§ss

The Same. Another kind of‘ unconnectable' line which
similarly involves the first ‘antipathyss is formed from a
trochaic dimeter acatalectic and an iambic of three feet and
a half which by a shifting of the caesura becomes a trochaic
procatalectic :

I have a pretty little daughter who looks like *a
golden flower, my darling Clei's, for whom Ι would
not take all Lydia, nay nor lovely [Lesbos]

Of these lines, the second is shown hythe caesura to be
composed‚ as I have said, of the troc-haic dimeter acatalectie
and the iambic of three feet and a half; the first, having the
caesura a syllable earlier, becomes procatalectic‚ composed
of a trochaic of three feet and a half, 6ἔσπί μοι κάλα παϊς.’
and a dimeter acatalectic, ‘ χρυσίοισιν ὰνθέμοισιν ' ; while the
third consists of a hypercatalectic troclmic, ‘ ἀντὶ ‘riis ἔγω οὐδὲ
Λυδίαν,’ and a brachycatalectiQ ‘ πᾶσαν οὐδ ” ἐργίινναν.γ v
