immortal face, didst gently ask what ailed me, and
why I called, and what this wild heart would have
done, and ‘whom shall I make to give thee room
in her heart's love, who is it, Sappho, that does thee
wrong? for even if she flees thee, 5116 shall soon
pursue3 if she will not take thy gifts, she yet shall

my sore trouble and do what my heart would fain
have done, thyself my stay in battle.

[Longinus] The Snblz'mc: Since everyt-hing is naturally
aceompauied by certain assixes or accidents coexistent with
its substance, it follows that we should find the source of
sublimity in the invariable choicc of the most suitable ideas,

choose. Sappho, for instance, always expresses the emotions
proper to love-madness by means of its actual and visible
concomitants. If you ask where she displays her excellence,
Ι reply that it is where she shows her skill, first in choosing,
’ and then in combining, the best and the most marked of

those concomitants. Compare this z
