s best ascribed to Thaletas of Gortyn, Xenodamus

. ., Xenocritus . . .‚ Polymnastus . . ., and
Sacadas. For we are told that the F east of Naked
Youths at Spartal . . . was due to these musicians

. . Thaletas, Xenodamus, and Xenocritus were
:omposers of Paeans.

Plutarch on Music: Many circumstances could be
„ited to show that good music has been a matter of con-
:ern to the best-regulated states, and not least among
hese the quelling of a rising at Sparta by Terpander
1 . . And according to Pratinas, Thaletas the Cretan
!··h0 is said to have been invited thither at the in-
tance of the Delphic oracle to heal the Spartans by
{f is music, rid their city of the plague which ravaged it.
ζ The Same: As for Thaletas of Crete, it is doubted
41611181· he composed Paeans. Glaucus, who puts
ᾖ im later than Archilochus, declares that he imi—
ed that poet with the difference that his songs
were longer and he employed the Paeonio and
‘'retic rhythms. These had not been used by
Archilochus, nor indeed by Orpheus or Terpander,
-ut are said to have been derived by Thaletas, who
,hus showed himself a great poet, from the flute-

nusic of Olympus

Α Porphyrius Lg'fe quyllzayot-as: He used to amuse
iimself alone in his own house of a morning by
·inging certain ancient paeans of Thales to his own

mcompaniment on the lyre.
