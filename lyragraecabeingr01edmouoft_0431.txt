Scholiasta on Iliad: χέραδος ‘stone-heap’ : according to
Apollodorus this means a quantity of stones from the sea or
from a river, which we call pebbles 3 others call them χεράδια
οι· ‘hand-stone& because one of them just fills the hand.

The word occurs in Alcaeus :

1f you move from a stone-heap a block of stone
that is not firm set, then ’tis like you will get a
sore head.
