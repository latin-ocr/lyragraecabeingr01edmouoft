76 To THE MYTILENEANS
From a Second-Century Papyrus:

. But he goes striding wide over your heads,
and you hold your tongues like initiates when they
behold the dead they have called up. Nay rather,
my fellow- c-ountry men, up and quench the log while
it but smoulders among you, lest the light theieof

come to a brighter flame. 1

From the Same· ‘7

You were not altogether a knave . . .‚ . . ‚2 nor
yet a fool, but kept the oath you 511016 to us by the
altar of the Son of Leto, that none of the Children of
Treason should know truly 11110 it 11· 15 to 11110111 in

the beginning . . .
