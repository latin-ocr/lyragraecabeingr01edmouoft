3 longs from Thalamae there is a place 011 the sea called

the people of Thalamae was the birthplace of the Dioscuri,

8-15 To LYCAEAN Zeus

Maximus Planudes Οιι Hermoyenes: The metrieal systems
of lyric poetry consist of strophe, antistrophe and epode.
Of these the strophe comes first, and consists of two or more
similar or dissimilar lines, as in this of Alcman (43), where it is
composed of three dactylic lines of the same metre, and in
this, where it is made up of unlike lines :

Hither, Muse, sweet clear Muse of. the many
tunes and everlasting song, and begin a new lay for
maids to sing.2
