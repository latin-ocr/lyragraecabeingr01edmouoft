ALCAEUS
160 1

Aristotle Politics: Some aesymnetes ruled for life, others
only for definit-e periods or till they had accomplished
definite tasks, as the Mytileneans chose Pittacus to deal
with the exiles under Antimenidas and the poet Alcaeus.
Now Alcaeus shows that Pittacus was elected tyrant in one
of his Dra'nlciyzq-soays, where he chides his fellow-countrymen

saymg:

With one voice they have set up the base-born
Pittacus to be tyrant of their spiritless and ill-staroed
country, shouting his praise by their thousands.2
