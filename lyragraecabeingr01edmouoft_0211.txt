Hermogenes Kinds of Scyle [on sweetness or charm]: All
clean and honest, pleasures may be described simply, as for
instance the beauty of a place, the variety of trees and
plants, the sneet diversity of iixers and brooks. Such
things give pleasure to the c>e when they are seen, and to
the ear when they are told of. Compare Sappho:

And by the cool w atcrside the breeze rustles
arriid the apple—branches, and the quivering leaves
shed lethargy3
