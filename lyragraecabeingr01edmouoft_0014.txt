PREFACE

on the actual MSS. ; where Ι have used only photo-
graphs the results should be taken as still requiring
corroboration. The latter cases are indicated in the
footnotes.

The arrangement of the Fragments follows, where
this can be inferred, the arrangement of the editions
current in the later a11tiquity3 but it must not be
understood as certainly reproducing it. Cross-refer-
ences to the numerations of Bergk and Hiller-Crusius
will be found on page 431. I have added a separate
index of the ancient authors, including those to
whom we are indebted for most of our knowledge of
these poets and their works. Among the modern
writers who have collected, emended, and interpreted
the Fragments, next to Bergk1 and those on whom
he drew—Ahrens, Bekker, Benseler, Bentley, Blom-
field,2 Boissonade, Brunck, Cobet, Cramer, Gaisford,
Hartung, Hecker, Hermann, Keil, Kock, Matthiae,
Meineke, O. Miiller, Nauck, Neue, Porson, Reiske,
Schneidewin,3 Scliweigli‘ausei·,4 Seidler, Ursinus, Vol-
ger, Voss, XVelcker, Wolf—I owe most to E. P.
Grenfell, A. S. Hunt, Kaibel and U. von &Vilamowitz-
Moellendorff. My obligations to these, as to other
recent and living scholars, are indicated in the notes. ·
Ι must here record my thanks to the Director of the
British Museum for permission to reproduce the
Sotades vase, and to the Council of the Egypt Ex-
ploration Fund for allowing me to print the Oxy-
rhynchus Fragments; to l). Bassi, J. Harrower,
W. Schubart, and the Directors of the Bibliotheque
Nationale and of Graz University, for supplying me
with photographs of papyri and other MSS. in their
care. And 1 gratefully acknowledge the help and
