Proclus Chrestomathy: According to Pindar the
dithyramb was invented at Corinth, and we are
told by Aristocles that the originator of this song

was Arion, the first trainer of the cyclic or circular
chorus.

Eusebius Clzronicle : Fourth year of the 40th
olympiad (Bc. 617) : Flourished Arion of Methymna,
who was rescued by a dolphin off Taenarum.

Scholiast on Aristophanes [cyclic—chorus-trainer]:
Antipater and Euphronius . . . declare that the
cyclic or circular choruses were first asseinbled by
Lasus. . . . The earlier authorities, however, namely
Hellanicus and Dicaearchus, ascribe 'cheir origin to
Arion of Methymna, the former in his List of Carnem?
V ictors and the latter in his 'l'realz'se on the Musica]
Contests.
