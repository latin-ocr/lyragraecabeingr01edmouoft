TERPANDER

41 To 'run moseum

Dionysius of Halicarnassus U‹')1·11pose'lz'on [on rhythmis] :
The rhythm which consists entirely of long syllables—called
molossus by the writers on inetre—is clevated and ‹lignificd
and takes long strides ; and this is an example of it :

O [Sons] of Zeus and Leda, Saviours most beautiful.

Strabo G'eoqraphy [on Methylnnalz Arion was a singer to
the lyre; and according to tradition the same branch of
music had an exponent in a native of the same island,
Terpander, who was the first to use a lyre with seven strings
instead of four, as is recorded in the epic lines ascribed to

him:

To thee we will play new hymns upon a lyre of
sevenzstrings, and will love the four-voiced lay no
more.

Plutarch Life of Lyeurgus: Indeed if the reader will
consider the Laconian poetry of which some is still extant
and the march-rhythms the Spartans used to the tune of the
‘flate when they went into battle, he will conclude that both
Terpander and Pindar have good reason to connect valour
with music as the former does where he says of Sparta ε

Where bloom both the spear of the young men
and the clear sweet Muse, and eke that aider

unto noble 3deeds, Justice that goeth in broad
streets . . .

Johannes Lydus On the Months: According to Terpander
'of Lesbos, Dionysus, who is sometimes called Sabazius, was
nursed by Nyssa; he was the son of Zeus and Persephone
and was eventually torn in pieces by the Titans.4
