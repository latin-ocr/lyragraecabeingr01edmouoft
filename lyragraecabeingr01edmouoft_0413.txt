Cramer Iri-edita (Orsus-cl) . . . Or the form πέφυγα ‘ I have

Herodian Words without Parce-[ld ε πιέζω ‘ to press 'z verbs
ending in -ζω which are paroxytone and of more than two
syllables never have epsilon in the penultimam. . . . We

used in Attio and Ionic as well as in Homer. . . . I have
added the dialects because both forms, πιέζω and πιάζω,
occur in Alcaeus, and Alcman uses πιάζω.
