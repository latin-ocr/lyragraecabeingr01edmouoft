Pausanias Descriptz'on os [ἔνεπε [the styx] : 'l'hings of horn
and of bone, iron and copper‚ lead and tin and silver and
electrum, all are corrodcd by the water3 and gold suffers
like the other metals. And yet, that, gold remains pure οἱ
rust, is both declared by the Lesbian poetess and proved
by our own experience. It seems that God has given the
least-considered of things power over those that are deemed
to be of great price.

e. g. For gold is pure of rust.

devours it, and it overcomes ’che strongest of

mort-al hearts. 1

employing seven-⁶ time ' trochaics instead of six-⁴ time‚' as:
