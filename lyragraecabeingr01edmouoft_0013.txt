P REFACE

a pointed bracket indicates that the letters within
it are not or cannot have been in the MS. The
emendations and restorations for which 1 believe
myself to be responsible are marked lv) in the notes.
All restorations have been checked where possible
by a palaeographical method explained and exempli-
fied in various articles in the periodicals. Briefly, it
consists of the tracing of letter-groups from photo-
graphs of the extant portions of the papyrus or
vellum MS. suggestions are rejected which, when
traced out by this method, are shown, with all
reasonable allowance made for variation in the size
of the letters and the spaces between them, to
exceed or fall short of the requirements of the gap;
and where the gap is bounded 011 the left by an
imaginary marginal line, all suggestions are made to
correspond—again with all reasonable allowance
made—in what 1 may call for convenience ί written
length.' Scholars who have not tried this method
⁷ will be surprised, when they do, at the way in which
it reduces the possibilities. One instance must
suffice. In the first lines of Alcaeus 27, the letters
Δ Of παί]δων, ΑΙ Of πρώ]τᾳ, ΤΟ before γάρ, and Ι( Of
’ ἅλλ]αις, come immediately under one another. M etre
requires imo supplementary syllables in lines 1 and
’2, three in line 3, and one in line 4. All these
supplements must correspond in written length not
only with one another but with any suggestions
made for the four subsequent lines, and when they
are made the result must be not only a passage
satisfactory in metre, grammar, dialect and sentiment,
but something which Alcaeus might have written.
I should add here that so far as I have found it
practicable my work on the new Fragments is based
