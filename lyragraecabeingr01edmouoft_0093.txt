ALCMAN

25
Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner : Partridges arc called by some
writers κακκάβαι, notably by Alcman, who says :
Aye, and Alcman did put together the tongued

utterance of the caccabis, to make his twine of words
and music,

clearly indicating that he learnt to sing from the partridges.1

‘26

Antigonus of Carystus Marrels: The cock halcyons are
called ceryls, and when theygrow old and weak ancl unable
to fly, their mates carry them upon their wings3 and with
this is connected the passage in Alcman where he says that*
age has made him weak and unable to whirl round with the
choirs and with ‘che dancing of the maidens :

O maidens of honey voice so loud and clear, my
limbs can carry me no more. Would O would God
I were but a ceryl, such as flies fearless of heart with
the halcyons over the bloom of the wave, the Spring's
own bird that is purple as the sea Ι 2

γ fBfi the man's name Say-much, the woman’s Glad-
ο -a ,

by which he means ‘let the man speak and the woman be
content with whatsoever she shall hears
