Priscian Metrcs of Terence .· Morcover Alcman in his first
>book has a catalectic trimeter sometimes with and sometimes

νὲιίῑὶιουῖ an iambus in the fourth foot thus [—srasy. 8. I. 3 ;
ἰ 6ιί —

. . . And the temple pure of towered Therapnae ; 1
here he has a spondee in the fourth foot. Similarly :

. .l . Falleth dumb upon the shore among the
tang e ; 2

here, too, he has given the fourth foot a shoudee, for the
first syllable of φύκεσσι is long.

Aristides οη the Extemporz‘sed Acidinum: You hear the
Laconian‚ too, saying to himself and the chorus: ‘The
Muse’ etc.; note also that having at the outset asked the
Muse herself to inspire him, he then seems to change about
and says that the chorus who is singing the song has itself
done this instead of the Muse.

The Muse crieth aloud, that Siren clear and
ag. swcet. But Ι had no need, it seems, to invoke

her. aid, seeing that you yourselves, ye maidens,
have inspired me with so loud a voice.

Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes Ανῃοηαιιίιέα [Aetolian
Leda]: It is true that Pherecydes says in his second Book
that Leda and Althaea were daughters of Thestius by Lao-
ghonte daughter of Pleuron; but that Leda was daughter of

laucus is implied by Alcman thus ε

. . . his sons by the blessed daughter of Glaucus
