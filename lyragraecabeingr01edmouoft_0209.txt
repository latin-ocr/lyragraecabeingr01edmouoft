SAPPHO

It is to be a God, methinks, to sit before you and
listen close by to the sweet accents and winning
laughter which have made the beart in my breast
beat so fast and high. When Ι look on you,
Brocheo,1 my speech comes short or fails me quite,
Ι am tongue-tied2; in a nloment a delicate fire has
overrun my flesh, my eyes grow dim and my ears
sing, the sweat runs down me and a trembling takes
me altogether, till Ι am as green and pale as the
grass‚3 and death itself seems not very far away 3 4—-
but now that I am poor, Ι must fain be content 5 . . . .

Is it not· marvellous how she has recourse at once to spirit,
body, hearing, tonguo‚ sight, flesh, all as quite separate
things, aud by contraries both freezes and burns, rai-es and

is sane, and indeed is afraid she is nearly dead, so that she ’

expresses not one emotion but a concourse of emotions?
Now all such things are characteristic of the lover, but it is
the choice, as I said, of the best and the combination of them
into a single whole, that- has produced the excellence of the
piece.⁵
