, Scholiast on the Iliad [ἐπισχοίης πόδας ‘mightest set thy
feet vupon⁷]: Resembling in type the forms ἰοίην ‘I might
go ' alul ἆγαγοίην,

in Sappho . . .‚ the word ἐπισχοίης was rightly aeeented
paroxytone.

Choeroboscus οη tlte Canons qf Theodosius [on nouus in
-vv]: κίνδυν ‘danger‚' genitive κίνδυνος, accusative κῖνδυνα;
{appho thus declined the noun κίνδυνος; Alcaeus used the

ative κινδυνι.

185

John of Alexandria: The acute aec-ent falls on the last
syllable or on the peuultimate or on the antepenultimate,
but not further back ; for I do not count the form Μήδεϊα,

Medea,

which is found in Sappho, because she has separated the
vowels of the diphthong ci.

186

Cramer Ineclica (Oaesorcl): And the genitive plural of
Μοῦσα iS Μωσάων in Laconian‚ aud Μοισαίων,

of the Muses,
in Sappho.

187
Phrynichus The Attieist: m‘tron,

soda:

this word would be pronounced by an Aeoliam as Sappho
writes it, with an η, but by an Athenian with an l.
