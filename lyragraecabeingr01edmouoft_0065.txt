ALCMAN

Lm:

Suidas Lesicon: Alcman :—A Laconian of Messoa,
wrongly called by Crates a Lydian of Sardis. A
lyric poet, the son of Damas or, according to some
authorities, of Titarus. He flourished in the 37th
Olympiad (3.0. 631-625), when Ardys father of
Alyattes was king of Lydia. He was of an extremely
amorous disposition and the inventor of love-poems,
but by birth a slave. He wrote six Books of lyric
poems, and was the first to adopt the practice of not
accompanying the hexameter with music.l Being a
Spartan, he uses the Doric dialect.

Aelian Historical DIisceZlanies [see above on Ter-

pander, p. 27].

Velleius Paterculus Roman History: The Spartan
claim to Alcman is false.

Palatine Anthology: Alexander of Aetolia:
Ancient Sardis, abode of my fathers, had I been

ἒ reared in you l should have been a maund—bearer

 

unto Cybele or beaten pretty tambours as one of her
gilded eunuchs ; but instead my name is Alcman and
my home Sparta, town of prize-tripods, and the
lore I know is of the Muses of Helicon, who have
made me a greater king even than Gyges son of
Dascylus.

The Same: Antipater of Thessalonica on Alcman :

¹ or: ‘of singing to the lyre or fiute songs whose (chief)
metre was not hexameter ’ ⁴?
