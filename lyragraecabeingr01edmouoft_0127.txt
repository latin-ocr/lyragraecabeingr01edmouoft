ALCMAN

old Etmnoloqicaecm A'llaqnmnt ὑλακόμωροι (an epithet of dog

od. 14. 29) : given to barking busy with barking: or, accord-
ing to another view, sharp-voiced, like ἐγχεσίμωρος, because of
the sharpness of the spears (ἔγχη), for μόρος in the Cyprian
dialect means sharp. But it is better to take it as toiling
(μορέω) over their barking, because of their keeping awake.
Or perhaps raising their bai-k, that is giving a shrill bark ;
compare Alcman :

raises for me his insatiable little tune 1
