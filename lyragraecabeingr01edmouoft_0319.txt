SAPPHO

Maidenhead, maidenhead, whither away?
and it replies in the samc figure z
Where I must stay, bride, where l must stay.

For there is more chax-m in it put thus than if the figure
were not employed and it were said but once. Now repe-
tition would seem to have been invented more with a view
to an effect of energy or force,l but Sappho employs even
what is most forceful in a charming way.

Demetrius On Scyle: And that is why when Sappho sings
of beauty her words are full of beauty and sweetness, and
the same when she sings of love and springtimc and the
halcyon, and the pattern of her poetry is inwoven wit-h every
beautiful word thereis, some os them made by herself.

Strabo G'eoyrczphy: Canae is a little town of the Locrians
of Cynus opposite the southernmost Cape of Lesbos, situated
in Canaea, a district which extends as far as the islands of
Arginusae and the cape which lies near them. This cape is
called by some writers Aiga ‘the goat,' after the anima13
but the second syllable ought rather to bc made long, Aiga,
like ἀκταί and ἀρχοί; for that is the name of the whole
mountain which is now called Cane 01¹ Canae ; . . . later the
actual promontory seems to have been known as Aiga, as
Sappho gives it, and eventually as Cane or Canae.

Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes Argonautica [‘ So I am
not the only visitant, of the Latmian cave’]: . . . The love
of the Moon-goddess is told of by Sappho, and by Nicander
in the Qud Book of the Europa ; and it is said that the Moon
comes down to Endymion in this cave.
