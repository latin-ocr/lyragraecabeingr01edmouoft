fair Lesbian, if it is right to argue from one age

beloved were many in number and that they were
captivated by all beautiful persons. What Alcibiades,
Charmides, and Phaedrus were to him, Gyrinna,2
Atthis, and Anactoria were to her, and what his
rival craftsmen, Prodicus, Gorgias, Thrasymachus and
Protagoras were to Socrates, that Gorgo and Andro-

to task and at others refutes them and dissembles
with them exactly like Socrates
