Scholiast on Hermogenes Kz'ncls qs* Scyle: For some kinds
of style express but one sort of idea, for instance the pure
or simple kind3 others two, three, or even four, for instance
the noble and those which resemble it, such as the klnds
used by historiam—which, indeed, as Thucydides says,
approximate to those employed by mythographers because
they are eoncerned with chronology—-, or such as give
pleasure to the senseS‚ sight, hearing, smeH, taste, touch, as
Homer: (Iliad 347 f); or Sappho: (4) 3 and:

Like the pippin blushing high
On the 'eree-top beneath the sky,
there the pickers forgot it—nay,
Could not reaeh it so far away ; 2

or Theocritus: (8. 78) and: (3. 54).

Demetrius On Style: The so-ealled epiphoneme may be
defined as a phrase which adds adornment, and it is supreme
as an elevator of style. It should be remembered that a
phrase either aids the sense or adorus it. For instance, the
sense is aided by such a phrase as ‘ Like the hyaeinth' etc.
while it is adorned by the words which follow, ‘ and it still
blooms’ etc. The addition thus made to the foregoing
sentence is clearly an adornment or embellishment. . . . In
general the epiphoneme is like the shows or displays of the
rich, such as the cornices and triglyphs of their houses and

the purple borders of their robeS. For it is essentially a mark
of wealth in words.
