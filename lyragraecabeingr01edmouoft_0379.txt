Eust. on the Odyssey [they were diverting themselves at
draughts] ε The author of the treatise On Greek lr‘oemffl declares
that the draughts were five pebbles with which they played
upon five lines drawn on either side, so that each of the
players had his own . . . And there was a line drawn in
the middle which they called sacred . . . because the loser
comes to the furthest line. Hence the proverb ‘to move
the piece on the sacred line‚' used, of course, of those whom
desperation drives to their last resource3 compare Sophron ε
. . . . ; Alcaeus gives the phrase in full:

And now this fellow has prevailed, by moving the
piece on the sacred line, the cunning man.

Scholiast on Pindar [‘ the overwhelniing bane which his
father hung over him, to wit a mighty stone ²] ε The punish·
ment, of Tantalus is variously related . . . . ; Alcaeus and
Alcman say that a stone was hung over hin13 compare
Alcaeus:

Over Tantalus' head, O son of Aesimus, there

hung a great stone3
and Alcman (Alcm. 89).
