I'REFACE

encouragement 1 have received from Mrs. Adam,

H. Ι. Bell, S. G. Campbell, A. B. Cook, R. D. Hicks,
H. Rackham and A. J. B. Wace.

An account of the MS. tradition when the authors
concerned run into the sixties is a formidable affair,
and would be beyond the scope of this book. For
the most important, the scholar will find much of
what he requires in O. H offmann’s (i2·iec!2i.s·‹·lze Dialekte
and in the introduction to A. C. Pearson's Fragments
of Sophocles. The em ”lier history of the text h·1s
been abl) w·01ked out by Wil··11nowitz in the w·oik s
mentioned in the Bibliogmph). Bv .t it should be
borne in mind th ·1t statements on the Aeolic metres
and dialect published before 1914 may need modi-
fication. I cannot hope that the many references
in this book are quite exhaustive, modern, and
correct. But Ι have done my best to make them SO.
A few not quite obvious errors, of which the worst
is Ale.ramlricle.s· for Ana.1-anclricles on pp. iOO and lOl,
,will be found corrected in the Indexes. In the
translation of Sappho fr. 35 the proverb should be
in square brackets. The omitted fragments of
merely palaeographical value will be found in the
Papyrus Col]ections—O„rzsrlqy22cl1us, Berliner K Iassii-er-
texte, Halle, Societsi Italicum. It will perhaps be
useful to the reader to know that Volume II, which
is already in the press, includes Stesichorus, Ibycus,
Anacreon, and Simonides, and that Volume ΙΙΙ.,
which is in preparation, will include Corinna, Bacchy-
lides, Timotheus, the Scolia, the Folk-Songs, the
Anacreontea, and the Adespota, with an account of
Greek Lyric Poetry.
