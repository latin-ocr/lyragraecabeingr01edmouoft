ALCAEUS

e. g. And when thou stolest away the oxen of
Apollo, 'tis true he found them, being Lord oi
divination; but when he threatened thee full
direly‚ then thou stolest away the very bow and
arrows that were upon his shoulder : whereat he
smiled, and gave thee the divining-staff from
which men know thee to this day as ‘ God of the
golden wand‚’ and himself received from thee

the lyre whence he is called ⁶ Wielder of gold.’

6 To ATHENA

Strabo Gcoyraphy: When they conquered Coronea, the
Boeotians built in the plain which lies before it> the temple
of Itonian Athena, calling it after the Thessaliam one, and
named the river which flows beside it Cuarius after the river
in Thessaly. But Alcaeus calls it Cofflius, saying:

O Queen Athena, upholder of War, who standest,
we knOW, watching over Coronea before a stream-
flanked temple on the banks of the Coiilius . . .

f Aiidlit is here that they used to hold the Pan-Boeotian
estu-a .
