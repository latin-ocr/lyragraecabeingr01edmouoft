LIFE OF ALCAEUS

Hephaestion On Graplzical Sigus: The asterisk is
usually employed if the poem which follows is in
a different metre. This is more often the case with
those composed in triads than with the mono-
strophic poems of Sappho, Anacreon, and Alcaeus.
The poems of Alcaeus are peculial· in this, that in
the Aristophanic edition the asterisk was used only
to mark a change of metre, but in the now current

edition of Aristarchus it marks a fresh poem what-
ever the metre.

Athenaeus Doclors al Dinner: Having completed
my digression on ancient methods of mixing wine,
I will resume my theme and consider what the bric
poet Alcaeus means 1)5 the phrase Mix ele §ou
pour it one and two.' Some authorities hold that
he does not refer to the pr·0p01tion of wine to water
but, being a temperate man, would have us drink
first one ladleful of unmixed wine and then two, and
no more. This is the interpretation of Chamaeleon

of Pontus, but he does not realise how fond of the
bottle Alcaeus was.1

The Same [on the collabos]: The love of the
Sicilians for this game is proved by the fact that
they went so far as to build special rooms to play it

in, as we are told by Dicaearchus in his tract On
Alcaeus.2

Strabo Geography [on Lesbos]: the historian Hel-
lanicus, too, was a Lesbian, and Callias the com-
mentator on Sappho and Alcaeus.3
