Plutarch On tlte Cessacion of Oracles: On a recent visit to
Ammon it was clear he had been particularly struck with
the ever-burning lamp, ⁴tbout which he told us an interesting
circumstance related to him b3 the priests. It seems that
the3 use less oil f01 it ev·e13 3ear, and since it is 0nl3
reasonable to suppose that the less the oil consumed the
shorter the time of burning, the3 believe this to be an
indication that the length of the 3eai is not constant, but
that each is shorter than its predecessor. At this there was
general astonishment, and Demetrius exclaimed that it was
really absurd to pursuc so great a quest with such tiny
equipment, not, 111 Alcaeus’ phrase,
